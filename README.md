Subsonic* is a media streaming server that is similar to Plex, but focuses on music rather than video.  This channel should allow Subsonic streams to be played through Plex.
 
Original plugin available from: https://github.com/caveatsCode/subsonic.bundle

To install:
-----------
Download the subsonic.bundle folder from github.  Copy the folder into your Plex plugins folder (you may need to change the name from 'subsonic.bundle-master' to 'subsonic.bundle').  Restart the Plex Media Server.
First, go to 'Preferences' to enter your Subsonic server address, username and password.
You should not need to edit any files to get the channel to work- all setup is done within the Plex client.

To do list:
-----------
- Improve directory browsing
- Search function
- Shuffle
- find a way to show a better artist page

*You need Subsonic Premium to use this channel.  It currently costs $1 per month from the Subsonic website (http://www.subsonic.org/pages/premium.jsp).
